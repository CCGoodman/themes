# Discord Themes

a collection of custom themes for Discord, designed to modify the appearance of the app to better suit your preferences. Each theme is a separate CSS file that you can apply to Discord using a third-party plugin such as BetterDiscord, Vencord.

# Getting Started
To use the themes, you'll need to first install one of the plugins. Here are the best ones:
